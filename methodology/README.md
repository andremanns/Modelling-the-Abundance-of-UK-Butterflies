## Key Terms
### Baseline Index
This is the count recorded in the baseline year (1993) for a single species at a single site.

### Relative Abundance / Index Ratio
Relative Abundance (RA) and index ratio have the same meaning and are used interchangeably through the report. They describe the increase or decrease of a species count at a site in a specific year, relative to its baseline year. For example, if species code A received 8 counts at site code 1 in 1993, but 20 counts from the same site in 1997, the relative abundance for 1997 would be 2.5. Similarly, if in 2005, only 2 counts were recorded, the relative abundance for that year would be 0.25. This way a relative decrease is represented by values less than 1, and an increase by values greater than 1. The formula is shown below:
